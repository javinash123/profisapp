Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/
✖ Check for issues with Metro config
- "resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup" mismatch. Expected false, got: true
Advice:
Modifying the "metro.config.js" is dangerous and may lead to unintended consequences.
Unless you know what these overrides do, remove them and adopt the recommended values from "expo/metro-config".
✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  react-native@0.76.6 - expected version: 0.76.9
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
Found outdated dependencies
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
